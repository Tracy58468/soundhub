## What is the name of your App?
**SoundHub**
<br /><br />
## What does your app do?
Originally, it was to be a workflow to automate getting song links from all the major music streaming platforms and sharing them with others.

The originator of the idea (and also our Android developer) had a personal issue that required that he leave the team. The rest of the team decided to focus on creating a web app, instead of an Android app plus a web app.
